  <h1>Automated Market Makers and Loss-versus-Rebalancing (LVR): a Deep Dive into Decentralized Finance</h1>
  <p>Tutorial at <a href="https://ec24.sigecom.org">EC'24</a></p>

  <h2>Introduction to the topic</h2>
  <p>In recent years, automated market makers (AMMs) have emerged as an alternative to the most common market structure used for electronic trading, the limit order book, and have been the dominant market mechanism for trust-less decentralized exchanges.
    AMMs have recently emerged as the dominant market structure for asset exchange in blockchains.
    Compared to electronic limit order books (LOBs), which are the dominant market structure for traditional, centralized exchange-based electronic markets, AMMs offer some advantages.
    First of all, they are efficient computationally. They have minimal storage needs, and matching computations can be done quickly, typically via constant-time closed-form algebraic computations. In an LOB, on the other hand, matching engine calculations may involve complex data structures and computations that scale with the number of orders. Thus, AMMs are uniquely suited to the severely computation- and storage-constrained environment of blockchains; as such, computer scientists have a key interest in the topic.
    Second, LOBs are not well-suited to a "long-tail" of illiquid assets. This is because they require the participation of active market makers. In contrast, AMMs mainly rely on passive liquidity providers (LPs).
    These key characteristics make AMM-based markets observe structural differences with traditional markets.</p>
  <p>
    The focus of the tutorial will be on the pre-eminent model of the underlying economics of AMMs, developed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06046">Milionis et al. (2022)</a>, centering on the main adverse selection cost incurred by liquidity providers in such exchanges, called "loss-versus-rebalancing" (LVR).
    We will go into the multiple ways to interpret the intuition behind adverse selection in these new markets, and then develop the necessary math to give a closed-form expression for LVR in AMMs.
    In the case of the constant product market, this leads to a concise expression: σ²/8, where σ is the volatility of the price process.
    The main goals of this tutorial are to learn about the market structure of AMMs, the reason why LVR is an important quantity in DeFi, how it applies to data, and how to mathematically analyze it.</p>

  <h2>Part 1: AMMs and the multiple facets of LVR</h2>
  <p>This part of the tutorial will focus on a conceptual understanding of the market structure posed by AMMs, as well as the multiple structural results. No knowledge of AMMs will be assumed.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Introduction to AMMs: market that always accepts orders to buy/sell at a quoted price</li>
      <li>High-level, conceptual market structure: arbitrage, adverse selection, relation to loss in prediction markets</li>
      <li>Discrete notion of adverse selection in AMMs: sum defined for a trade sequence with respect to an AMM and an external price trajectory</li>
      <li>Mathematically equivalent ways to characterize LVR:
          <ul>
              <li>Cost of informational asymmetry: the AMM does not have access to accurate market prices</li>
              <li>Hedging interpretation: the market mechanism has inventory of a risky asset which changes value; factoring out the changes in value of the underlying ("eliminating market risk") leads to discrete delta-hedging, e.g., every 5 minutes, adjust a short position on asset in an external venue</li>
              <li>Profit of arbitrageurs trading against AMMs</li>
              <li>Optionality cost: time value for giving up future optionality on market strategy</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Example empirical analysis in an actual market (Uniswap v2)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Part 2: the mathematics behind LVR</h2>
  <p>This part of the tutorial will delve into the mathematical details underlying the structural characterizations and conceptual understanding.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Representation results around AMMs: dual representation, invariant ↔ demand curves</li>
      <li>Stochastic calculus: introduction to reasoning about continuous-time stochastic processes</li>
      <li>Ito's lemma: the key tool to analyze functions of stochastic processes, dominant second-order effects</li>
      <li>Closed-form formula for LVR in AMMs via Ito's lemma</li>
      <li>Derivation of σ²/8 in special case of constant product market</li>
  </ul>
