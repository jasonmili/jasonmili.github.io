I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Christos Papadimitriou](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christos-papadimitriou) and [Tim Roughgarden](https://timroughgarden.org). My research interests span the intersection of Algorithmic Game Theory and Economics with emerging areas of computation, especially blockchains and machine learning. On the former, I study blockchains and their applications (especially in decentralized finance) as innovative frameworks that pose unique incentive alignment challenges. I previously graduated with the highest honors from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in Electrical and Computer Engineering, majoring in Computer Science, where I was advised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis).
