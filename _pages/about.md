I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Christos Papadimitriou and Tim Roughgarden. I am broadly interested in Game Theory, especially in combination with Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems. One more specific research interest of mine is to theoretically study and give robust guarantees on Decentralized Finance (DeFi), where I am currently working on AMMs (Automated Market Makers), stablecoins, and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Previously, I graduated with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).
