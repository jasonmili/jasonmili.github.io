I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Christos Papadimitriou and Tim Roughgarden. I am broadly interested in Game Theory, especially in conjunction with Machine Learning, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). On the latter, in particular, I theoretically study and give robust guarantees on DeFi, where I am currently focusing on AMMs (Automated Market Makers), stablecoins, and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Previously, I graduated with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).
