I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Christos Papadimitriou](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christos-papadimitriou) and [Tim Roughgarden](https://timroughgarden.org). I am broadly interested in Game Theory, especially in conjunction with Machine Learning, and Blockchains. On the latter, in particular, I study blockchains and their applications as an innovative computational framework that poses unique incentive alignment challenges and enhances the traditional game theoretic landscape of Mechanism Design. Previously, I graduated with highest honors in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), where I was advised by [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis).
